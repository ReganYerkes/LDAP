Below is a simplified example of code for maintaining directory information in a distributed system without comments:

```python
import json
import requests

class DistributedDirectory:
    def __init__(self, base_url):
        self.base_url = base_url

    def get_entry(self, key):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/entries/{key}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        return response.json()

    def add_entry(self, key, value):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/entries/{key}"
        data = {"value": value}
        response = requests.post(url, json=data)
        return response.status_code

    def update_entry(self, key, value):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/entries/{key}"
        data = {"value": value}
        response = requests.put(url, json=data)
        return response.status_code

    def delete_entry(self, key):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/entries/{key}"
        response = requests.delete(url)
        return response.status_code

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    directory = DistributedDirectory("https://distributed-directory.example.com")

    # Add an entry
    directory.add_entry("key1", "value1")

    # Get an entry
    entry = directory.get_entry("key1")
    print("Entry:", entry)

    # Update an entry
    directory.update_entry("key1", "new_value")

    # Delete an entry
    directory.delete_entry("key1")
```

In this code:

- We define a `DistributedDirectory` class representing a distributed directory for storing key-value pairs.
- The class provides methods for adding, getting, updating, and deleting entries in the directory.
- We use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to interact with the distributed directory.
- Example usage demonstrates how to use the `DistributedDirectory` class to perform basic operations on the directory.

This is a basic example, and you can extend it to handle more complex directory operations or implement additional features such as replication, consistency, and fault tolerance as needed in a distributed system.
